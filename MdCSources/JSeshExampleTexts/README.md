# UMdC
## Sample MdC documents from JSesh 7.32

The JSesh software is a hieroglyphic editor for texts encoded in the established Manuel de Codage (MdC) encoding. See https://jsesh.qenherkhopeshef.org/ where the application can be dowloaded for Windows and MacOS PCs.

A large selection of sample MdC-encoded texts are included with the JSesh installations.

The files here are cloned from the JSesh GitHub project, with permission. The source for these copies is https://github.com/rosmord/jsesh/tree/master/jsesh-installer/src/binary/texts which is the up to date set as of 2019-11-17.

A JSesh-MdC document is normally stored as a plain text .gly file which may contain JSesh extensions to the original 30 year old MdC encoding. 

These .gly files should be encoded in UTF-8 as used in these samples (The original .gly files were specified as being ASCII plain text). This should only matter if you have an old .gly file containing non-ASCII characters such as accented vowels such as é etc. where these should be amaented to Unicode.

I've provided these examples here for work and discussion relating to use of UMdC encoding of MdC documents.
