## UMdC Samples

A section of sample UMdC files (in preparation).

Initial drafts converted and edited by Bob Richmond:

Doomed Prince

The Discourses of the Eloquent Peasant

Papyrus Westcar

The Story of Sinhue

The Story of the Shipwrecked Sailor

See comments at the start of each file.

Some features of the enodings will make more sense when documented!
